# post-prod-automation-tools
Media workflow scripts for post production engineering tasks
# FFmpeg Transcode Automation

This Python script batch-transcodes all video files in a folder into H.264 MP4 proxies using FFmpeg. It also generates a CSV report of the results.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Supports .mov, .mxf, .mp4, and .avi files
- Uses FFmpeg with x264 encoding
- Auto-creates output directory and logs status to CSV
- Command line execution, works cross-platform

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Install Python 3.9+ and FFmpeg
2. Place your source files into the `sample_input` folder
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 transcode_to_mp4.py
4. Check `output/` for proxies and `transcode_log.csv` for results

# 🎞️ Post Production Automation Tools

Welcome! This repository contains Python and Bash tools built to automate real-world workflows in post-production environments — from transcoding to metadata extraction to delivery automation.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Henry D. Thompson** — a post-production professional turned engineering-minded MBA candidate at Claremont Graduate University. After a decade working with top-tier clients like Netflix, HBO, and Warner Bros., I now focus on building efficient, scalable tools that bridge editorial, operations, and technology.

Currently interning at **NBCUniversal** in the Operations & Technology division, where I’m deepening my technical skill set to pursue a full-time role in media engineering.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

Studios and post houses are drowning in media, metadata, and manual work. I build tools that:
- Reduce clicks and errors
- Speed up delivery and QC
- Connect creative tools with engineering systems

If you're looking for someone who can think like an editor **and** build like an engineer — we should talk.
